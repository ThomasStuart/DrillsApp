/*  reoloadWithStepCount essentially copies over the data that has been stored in the tempData
      but ADDS the correct step count for each step.  This is important for th DrillDetail View.
      Cannot increment the step count inside of the view so this function is vital.  However
      it is innefficent beacuse it copies over the data and has to go through it again.
      I would change the json so that step numbers were included.
